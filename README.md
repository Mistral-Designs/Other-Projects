• The Truck Tutor - University Project. You could add a video of the song played on an organ and the lyrics next to the video. This helps the artists train fast for lives and the amateurs learn.

• The Coins Game - A game i made for a friendly studio, each tap produces coins, coins merged at hundreds producing a higher value coin and unlocking bonuses. Mainly an economics project if you ask me. Harder than it sounds.
